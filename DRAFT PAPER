Handling Missing Values:

when using the dataframe with cryptos as columns and closing price as rows, missing values appear:
  solana: 84% of missing values
  USD: 66% of missing values

as the amount of MV is big for these cryptos, they will be dropped.

two methods will be used for the remaining cryptos:
  #imputation (checking with median and mode, as both are used for skewed data);
  #starting the analysis from a point that we have records for all cryptos (except for the ones dropped).
  
  
    #IMPUTATION:
both median and mode have been applied and when checking the new statistics descriptions, we realized that when using the median, the values changed a lot comparing with the original dataset.
For this reason Mode will be used
